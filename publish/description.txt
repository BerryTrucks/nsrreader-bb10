Please, do not use reviews to report issues and ask questions because I can't even reply or contact you. Contact me directly via email with any questions, suggestions and found issues and I will try to resolve them as soon as possible. Any feedback is welcomed and important for future improvements.

If you like the app then the best support for me would be your positive review. This is the best thing which motivates to bring new features and improvements :)

* IMPORTANT * Do NOT disable Shared Files permission for the app because without that it can't read files.

Lite: Free version allows you to read only first 30 pages of the file.
